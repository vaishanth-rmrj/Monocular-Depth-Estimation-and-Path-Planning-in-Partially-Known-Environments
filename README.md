# Monocular-Depth-Estimation-and-Path-Planning-in-Partially-Known-Environments
This GitHub repo features a project on monocular depth estimation for 3D mapping and path planning in partially known environments using D star lite algorithm. It leverages deep learning to estimate depth from a single image and build a 3D map.
